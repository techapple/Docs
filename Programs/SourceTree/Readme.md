#SourceTree Keyboard Shortcuts

After wasting hours in search of a good list of keyboard shortcuts available in Atlassian’s SourceTree and feeling utter despair at how slow Atlassian is being at delivering this information, I thought I’d share the ones that I discovered through brute force and determination.

These were discovered and are only applicable on a Mac (although I am sure the Windows equivalents are easy to deduce), at the Commit All.. Screen (cmd + shift + c).

I would be extremely interested in hearing about any that are not already listed. Please post in the comments below.
